# Travel and Scenic Spots App

### The goal of this Application

This application retrieves all the scenic spot data from an API including its images, which allow the registered user to views and search for it, for example, if the user wants to search “Grand Canyon” it will display all the data and instruction about the “Grand Canyon” in Arizona, also displays a couple of pictures of it. Besides, users can add comments, making an appointment of visiting. marks of visited, rating this place with stars, making CRUD, create, read, update and delete custom scenic spot that you want to visit.


This app is created for users who are interesting and willing to travel around the world, stories they memories of happiness, making a plan of their traveling. 

The data I’m going to use includes its photo URL, name of a place, description of the traveling spot, if possible I will include its rating level of satisfaction(more detail will be include later)

For the homepage, I will create a fancy one, it looks attractive by using javascript or maybe some javascript libraries to achieve this. For example, some parallax scrolling effect, when user visiting this web application its background have movie effect, ask the user for login, if a user doesn’t have an account allow a user to create one. After the user login, the user can visit all the scenic spots around the world, create or update a new one.

For the database structure, I will include a user table that stores all the registered user information, I will protect user important information, another table for store custom location that a user wants to visits, this includes the name, location information, image URLs. Favorites table for store favorites spot. Table for countries of the location that belongs to. Table for the name of the scenic spot.etc 

* User
* Location
* Favorites 
* Countries
* Names


At this point, I’m maybe facing issues about which API I’m going to use, maybe going to interact with more than one API so I can combine them into the database if possible

### Stretch goals
* Allow user to search within a different category by countries 
* View history of the searching 
* Allow user to rates the location with stars 
* Add an overview map page that shows all the location to show visited
